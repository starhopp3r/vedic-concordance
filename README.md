# A Vedic Word Concordance

This repository contains five files:

- The two files named _Introduction_ and _Abbreviations_ are replicas of Bloomfield's chapters with the same titles. They include his explanations of the structure of the work as well as his comprehensive list of bibliographical sources and abbreviations. Relevant information regarding the six Vedic texts upon which this expanded version of the Concordance is based has been added to these files.

- The file named _Concordance_ is the primary working component of the archive. It is available in two formats (`.rtf` and `.doc`), both of which are compatible with Mac and Windows platforms. The files are Unicode-compliant and use the "Gandhari Unicode" font, developed by Andrew Glass and freely available for [download](https://github.com/gandhariunicode/gandhari_unicode_font). You may switch to any other font, provided it supports all the glyphs used for the transliteration of Sanskrit. Note that in the electronic Concordance, each entry is marked with a bullet (â€¢), while mantras and references are separated by a #-sign.

- The file named Copyright contains the terms governing the use of this work (also stated below under "Copyright Notice").
